##IUCAssignment1 folder is the one for the technical question regarding form submission.


###Set up a remote mysql database. 


1. welcome.php is the initial file to run which is the HTML/CSS.
2. index.php is the logic php script.It does the following:
..* Connects to the remote sql database.
..* Creates a table Degrees and drops if any such table exists before creating.
..* Takes the records from the xml form given in the description of the question.
..* Inserts the respective values from the records and populates the database table DEGREES.
..* Form Submission Logic where it takes values passed from welcome.php and inserts them into the database.
3. close.php which is the enclosing page which has the success message of the form submission.
